         - peek(), look_back(), has_next(), has_previous() now accept optional
           integer argument for arbitrary lookup, e.g. peek(2) looks at the next
           next item, peek(1) is the same as peek() (implemented by Alexey
           Surikov, github#2).

         - Take over maintenance from Stevan Little.

         - Now uses Dist::Zilla and git.

         - Add lowercase method name aliases (has_next() as well as hasNext(),
           etc). The lowercase method names are now the documented ones.

         - Add iterated() to check whether an iteration has been done (i.e.
           next(), or get_next(), or previous(), etc has been called).

0.05     2004-07-15  Released-By: STEVAN

         - added a getLegnth method and tested it

         - changed how currentIndex deals with index of 0, it now does it
           correctly.

         - made current use currentIndex to get the current index

         - made Array::Iterator more subclass friendly by adding some
           'protected' methods to access some fields with

         - added some subclasses: Array::Iterator::BiDirectional,
           Array::Iterator::Circular, Array::Iterator::Reusable

         - created tests for all these new modules


0.04     2004-05-06  Released-By: STEVAN

         - Changed current and currentIndex to refer to the same value (and
           index) of the last item dispensed by the next method. This is more in
           line with what they should do. Prior to this version they returned
           the current index which was actually the one past the last call to
           next.

         - tested these changes and altered tests which used the old versions.

         - updated documentation to reflect change
