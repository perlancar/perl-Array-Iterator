#ABSTRACT: A subclass of Array::Iterator to allow forwards and backwards iteration
__END__

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Array::Iterator::BiDirectional;

  # create an instance of the iterator
  my $i = Array::Iterator::BiDirectional->new(1 .. 100);

  while ($some_condition_exists) {
      # get the latest item from
      # the iterator
      my $current = $i->get_next();
      # ...
      if ($something_happens) {
          # back up the iterator
          $current = $i->get_previous();
      }
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Occasionally it is useful for an iterator to go in both directions, forward and backward. One example would be token processing. When looping though tokens it is sometimes necessary to advance forward looking for a match to a rule. If the match fails, a bi-directional iterator can be moved back so that the next rule can be tried.

=head1 METHODS

This is a subclass of Array::Iterator, only those methods that have been added are documented here, refer to the Array::Iterator documentation for more information.

=over 4

=item B<has_previous([$n])>

This method works much like C<hasNext> does, it will return true (C<1>) unless the begining of the array has been reached, and false (C<0>) otherwise.

Optional argument has the same meaning except that it specifies C<$n>th previous element.

=item B<previous>

This method is much like C<next>. It will return the previous item in the iterator, and throw an exception if it attempts to reach past the begining of the array.

=item B<get_previous>

This method is much like C<get_next>. It will return the previous item in the iterator, and return undef if it attempts to reach past the begining of the array.

=item B<look_back([$n])>

This is the counterpart to C<peek>, it will return the previous items in the iterator, but will not affect the internal counter.

Optional argument has the same meaning except that it specifies C<$n>th previous element.

=back

=head1 BUGS

None that I am aware of, if you find a bug, let me know, and I will be sure to fix it.

=head1 CODE COVERAGE
