#ABSTRACT: A subclass of Array::Iterator to allow circular iteration

=for Pod::Coverage .+

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Array::Iterator::Circular;

  # create an instance with a
  # small array
  my $color_iterator = Array::Iterator::Circular->new(qw(red green blue orange));

  # this is a large list of
  # arbitrary items
  my @long_list_of_items = ( ... );

  # as we loop through the items ...
  foreach my $item (@long_list_of_items) {
      # we assign color from our color
      # iterator, which will keep dispensing
      # as it loops through its set
      $item->set_color($color_iterator->next());
  }

  # tell us how many times the set
  # was looped through
  print $color_iterator->get_loop_count();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This iterator will loop continuosly as long as C<next> or C<get_next> is called. The C<has_next> method will always return true (C<1>), since the list will always loop back. This is useful when you need a list to repeat itself, but don't want to (or care to) know that it is doing so.

=head1 METHODS

This is a subclass of Array::Iterator, only those methods that have been added or altered are documented here, refer to the Array::Iterator documentation for more information.

=over 4

=item B<has_next>

Since we endlessly loop, this will always return true (C<1>).

=item B<next>

This will return the next item in the array, and when it reaches the end of the array, it will loop back to the beginning again.

=item B<get_next>

This method is now defined in terms of C<next>, since neither will even stop dispensing items, there is no need to differentiate.

=item B<is_start>

If at anytime during your looping, you want to know if you have arrived back at the start of you list, you can ask this method.

=item B<is_end>

If at anytime during your looping, you want to know if you have gotten to the end of you list, you can ask this method.

=item B<get_loop_count>

This method will tell you how many times the iterator has looped back to its start.
